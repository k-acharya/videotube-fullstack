#  VideoTube â€” Full Stack Video Sharing Platform

**VideoTube** is a full-stack video-sharing web application built using the MERN stack. It allows users to upload and watch videos, like and comment on them, and explore public channels â€” all through a responsive and modern UI. It supports secure authentication and media upload via Cloudinary.

##  Live Demo

 * [Frontend on Vercel](https://videotube-fullstack.vercel.app)

> The backend is hosted separately and accessed through Axios calls inside the frontend.

##  Whatâ€™s Included

This project showcases what Iâ€™ve learned in full-stack development â€” from secure user auth to file uploads and frontend integration. Here's whatâ€™s **fully working end-to-end**:

###  Core Functionality (Fully Integrated in UI)

- **Authentication**
  - Register and login using access + refresh tokens
  - Tokens stored in cookies with automatic refresh handling
  - Upload avatar and cover image (Cloudinary)

- **Video Upload + View**
  - Upload videos with thumbnails
  - View videos on a public feed (dashboard/homepage)
  - Watch individual videos on a dedicated video page

- **Likes +  Comments**
  - Like/unlike videos (only after login)
  - Add comments to videos (only after login)
  - View comments on video pages

- **Channel View**
  - View other users' profiles and uploaded videos
  - Subscribe/unsubscribe to users (shows count)

- **Watch History**
  - Tracks and displays videos you've recently watched (for logged-in users)

## !! Not Yet Integrated in UI

These features exist in the backend, but havenâ€™t been connected in the frontend yet:

-  Playlist creation and management  
-  Video deletion or editing  
-  Tweet/post feature  
-  Admin or moderation features

These may be added in the next versions of the project.
